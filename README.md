# Traxell Mixtapes
This project was originally built for the Learn With Jason [Web Dev Challenge Hackathon (E-comm Edition)](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-hackathon-algolia).

The goal of the hackathon was to build out an e-commerce site (with a twist) using technology from [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) - "the one-stop shop for AI search."

My idea was to build a music e-comm site. The twist to this site is that the "shopping cart" is limited to a mixtape in size. A shopper would go into the experience knowing that they have a 60-minute mixtape to fill (a 30 minute A-Side and 30 minute B-Side). They'll have to choose a name for their mix and carefully [curate the perfect selection of songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV7ORIKMCa8&t=26s).

## MVP

- Guests (non-authenticated) can build and view mixtapes, but cannot save mixtapes.
- Users (authenticated) can build, view, and save mixtapes.
- Music selection limited to sampling from only one genre / time-period of music to limit data for the demo
- Mock purchasability
- Easter 🥚🥚🥚🥚? Of course.

## Future Possibilities

- Wider music selection
- Edit mixtapes
- Allow shopper to switch between mixtape lengths: 60-minute, 90-minute, and 120-minute.
- Compare two mixtapes
- Create mixtape from existing
- Music library integration
- Music Platform integrations
